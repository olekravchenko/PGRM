possible further class structure:
private:
		double x0, x1, y0, y1;
		int Nx, Ny;
public:
		setBorder()		//Possibly the same way as def.Basis/ That's mean: fixing R-function as class method,
				but as C-code function it will be defined in "user's code"
		defineBasis() 	//How to create? I have an idea, but i'm not sure about it
		
		defineRightPart() //Both of them should work the same way, but has just a little bit different 
		defineSolution () // purpose
		
		SolvePDE()
		plot()
		
		
private:	internal functions of integrals,
		integrals them self  			//unnecessary for and user functions 
		matrix formers and solvers
